            I want to first acknowledge that I am joining you from unceded
            Traditional Coast Salish Lands including the Tsleil-Waututh
            (səl̓ilw̓ətaʔɬ), Kwikwetlem (kʷikʷəƛ̓əm), Squamish (Sḵwx̱wú7mesh
            Úxwumixw), and Musqueam (xʷməθkʷəy̓əm) Nations. And I want to also
            acknowledge that we're here talking about GIS, which is deeply
            rooted in settler expansion and natural resource inventorying. And
            so I think it's especially important for us as people thinking about
            or users of geographic information to recognize the role it has
            played on the history of the lands where we live. So please, at some
            point today take a moment now and then to think about Indigenous
            histories, territories, and knowledge systems in the context of of
            GIS, map-making, governance, and other topics that come up in
            discussion.

          <aside class="notes">
            Jumping into my presentation, I want to first just provide a little
            context for how my role fits into the scope of the GIS profession. -
            Technically I'm a librarian, and as a librarian, I'm an information
            manager. In my case geographic or spatial information. - What does
            that mean? Well, I like to describe the goals of my job as being to
            provide services and resources that will advance teaching, learning,
            and research at UBC, as well as the community. But all of my
            colleagues are librarians who have other special qualities that they
            bring to work. So, really I'm just part of a team of folks who act
            as point people for specific areas of research and education.
