            I want to first acknowledge that I am joining you on or surrounded
            by the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the
            xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), səl̓ilwətaɁɬ təməxʷ (Tsleil-Waututh),
            Stz’uminus (Chemainus), S’ólh Téméxw (Stó:lō), and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh
            Temíx̱w (Squamish) peoples. And I want to also acknowledge that we're
            here talking about GIS, which is deeply rooted in settler expansion
            and natural resource inventorying. And so I think it's especially
            important for us as people thinking about or users of geographic
            information to recognize the role it has played on the history of
            the lands where we live. So please, at some point today take a
            moment now and then to think about Indigenous histories,
            territories, and knowledge systems in the context of of GIS,
            map-making, governance, and other topics that come up in discussion.

          <aside class="notes">
            Jumping into my presentation, I want to first just provide a little
            context for how my role fits into the scope of the GIS profession. -
            Technically I'm a librarian, and as a librarian, I'm an information
            manager. In my case geographic or spatial information. - What does
            that mean? Well, I like to describe the goals of my job as being to
            provide services and resources that will advance teaching, learning,
            and research at UBC, as well as the community. But all of my
            colleagues are librarians who have other special qualities that they
            bring to work. So, really I'm just part of a team of folks who act
            as point people for specific areas of research and education. I
            included a picture here of the first library wherre I worked which
            was at WWU in Bellngham, WA. I worked there between 2004 and 2009 as
            an undergrad and grad student, and at that time maps were the
            primary focus of the library. You can tell by all of the map cases
            in the photos. But a lot has changed in the digital world since
            then, so my primary focus today is much different, which I'll talk
            about.

          <aside class="notes">
            I'll describe to you what I mean by resources – First, I oversee a
            collection of about 200k maps, with a particular strength of maps of
            BC and western canada. And as I showed in the last slide, maps and
            libraries have a long history together. Much of the use today in the
            map collection is based on historical research in a certain area,
            and GIS can be an important tool for understanding historical map
            features and information - even if it's found on paper. Next, we
            have a data collection which we make accessible to our users through
            a data repository. This is probably one of the most important
            aspects of my job, is to make sure our users have access to the data
            they need for their class assignment, teaching, or research. Much
            like a traditional librarian bought mostly books and journals, I buy
            data. I also provide access to proprietary software for users to
            work with spatial data. In many cases this requires the library to
            arrange a license for use, or wokring with our IT department to make
            sure the software can run in a lab setting. Then, there's the
            hardware - computers, printers, scanners, etc., as well as
            provisioning remote access to machines during COVID times. And
            finally space. along with my colleagues, we manage 2 computer labs.
            And we also provide space for our services which I'll talk about
            next.

            <h2>Services</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                consultations
              </li>

          <aside class="notes">
            As far as the services, one of the main ones is consultations where
            I meet with folks either as a group or as a team dicusss anything
            realted to access to or use of geospatial information. Sometimes
            this is an analytical consultation, where folsk are able to bounce
            questions off me regarding their approach to their analysis of
            spatial data. Other times consultations are more of a projecct
            scoping exercise where we'll look at the feasbility of an idea
            someone might have for a grant or research. So consultations can be
            for a very wide range of things. I also facilitate the development
            and delivery of open GIS workshops. Mainly these are beginner-level
            wokshops to get people started using or thinging about GIS. We
            usually offer ~ 8 workshops each term. Additionally, we have an
            active "help" email which is managed two phd students and myself, so
            it taps into the collective wisdom of our team. This has been super
            handy for folks to just ask quick question that not a lot of context
            is needed like, do you have data for landfills in BC, or traffic
            data, or whatever else. Then, of course a big part of what I do it
            partner with others on campus or in the community as an "spatial
            information specialist". For example Geodisy was a partnership
            between several librarians and organizations in Canada to build a
            spatail discovery layer for research data published here.
